# Portfolio Exercise KeepCoding Web
A site made using HTML and CSS.
The home page is composed by this sections:
* Navbar (About, Resume, Contact)
* Header
* Carousel of projects (images)
* Skillset with progess bars
* Social media links

The only useful link from the navbar is "Contact" that shows a form with some fields using RegEx validation.
It's also possible to click on "Projects" (the title of the carousel section). It redirects to a page that shows the different images from the carousel of projects.
